If you are ever developing on Windows and you use PuTTy a lot, if
you're like me you don't want to have to open the PuTTy session chooser GUI
and select it via the mouse, etc. PuTTy session chooser lets you type the
'psc' command (a .bat file) and it displays a list of available PuTTy sessions
from which you can choose. For example:

C:\dev\projects\putty-session-chooser>psc
0. Quit this program
1. alpha
2. beta
3. delta
4. epsilon
5. gamma
Choose session:

Once you choose a PuTTy session, it's opened immediately in a PuTTy window.

Put psc.rb and psc.bat somewhere on your system and make sure psc.bat is in
your PATH. Also, you'll need to change psc.bat to point to wherever you actually
put the psc.rb script.
